Magento WordPress Integration is the easiest way to get blocks and sessions from your Magento store.

== Description ==

**If you are using this plugin, then you may also be interested in my Magento extension - [Single Sign-on for Magento and Wordpress](http://codecanyon.net/item/single-signon-for-magento-and-wordpress/861453?ref=jamesckemp).**

Using the Magento WordPress Integration plugin you will be able to add any Magento blocks to your WordPress theme, including ones you have created yourself and static blocks created through the Magento admin area. You can also add any number of Magento products to your WordPress posts and pages, using the [shortcode & widget add-on](http://magentowp.com/add-ons/shortcodes-widgets/).

The Magento WordPress Integration Plugin allows you to to the following:

*   Bring out any of the default Magento Blocks in your WordPress theme.
*   Bring out any Magento blocks that you have created yourself.
*   Bring out any static blocks that you have made in your Magento admin area.
*   Show Magento products on a WordPress post or page by using the shortcode add-on.
*   Show products from any category using the widget add-on.

**If upgrading, please back up your database first!**

**Warning:** Version 2 of MWI has been completely re-written. None of the template functions from MWI v1.* will work anymore, so if you are upgrading, you will need to change the functions used within your WordPress themes to the [new and improved functions](http://magentowp.com/documentation/template-functions/).
