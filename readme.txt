Magento WordPress Integration is the easiest way to get blocks, sessions and products from your Magento store.

== Description ==

Magento WordPress Integration allows you to add any Magento blocks to your WordPress theme, including ones you have created yourself, and static blocks created through the Magento admin area. 

The Magento WordPress Integration Plugin allows you to to the following:

*   Bring out any of the default Magento Blocks in your WordPress theme.
*   Bring out any Magento blocks that you have created yourself.
*   Bring out any static blocks that you have made in your Magento admin area.

*	**[Shortcodes](http://bit.ly/1BAEynI)** Use the shortcode button to *insert products*, *layout blocks*, and *static blocks* in your WordPress editor.
