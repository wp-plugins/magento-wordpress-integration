Magento WordPress Integration is the easiest way to get blocks, sessions and products from your Magento store.

== Description ==

**If you are using this plugin, then you may also be interested in my Magento extension - [Single Sign-on for Magento and Wordpress](http://codecanyon.net/item/single-signon-for-magento-and-wordpress/861453?ref=jamesckemp).**

Using the Magento WordPress Integration plugin you will be able to add any Magento blocks to your WordPress theme, including ones you have created yourself and static blocks created through the Magento admin area. You can also add any number of Magento products to your WordPress posts and pages, using the [shortcode & widget add-on](http://mwi-plugin.com/add-ons/shortcodes-widgets/).

You can now show products from a specific Magento category per WordPress category, using the [category specifc widget add-on](http://mwi-plugin.com/add-ons/category-specific-widget/). This is great for content relevant cross-sells.

[Support](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/magento-wordpress-integration/) | [FAQ](http://mwi-plugin.com/documentation/faq/)

The Magento WordPress Integration Plugin allows you to to the following:

*   Bring out any of the default Magento Blocks in your WordPress theme.
*   Bring out any Magento blocks that you have created yourself.
*   Bring out any static blocks that you have made in your Magento admin area.
*   Show Magento products on a WordPress post or page by using the shortcode add-on.
*   Show products from any category using the widget add-on.

**Note:** This plugin does not allow you to completely avoid using Magento on your website, it simply helps you to get your WordPress and Magento themes seamlessly integrated.

**If upgrading, please back up your database first!**
